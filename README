DESCRIPTION
    This plugin for DB::Pluggable adds the "Th" command to the debugger,
    which displays a stack trace in HTML format, with lexical variables,
    using Devel::StackTrace::AsHTML. It then opens the page in the default
    browser using Browser::Open.

    The command name "Th" was chosen because the "T" command shows a plain
    text stack trace and "h" indicates that the output is HTML.

METHODS
  initialize
    Adds the "Th" command to the Perl debugger.
